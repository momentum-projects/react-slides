# React Studio Ghibli Slideshow

For this project you will build a component that allows a user to progress through a set of data, one item at a time.

The user will be able to navigate through a slideshow showing information about the films of Hayao Miyazaki.

Each "slide" should show the title of the film, the original title of the film in Japanese, the movie poster image, the film's release date, and description text about the film.

Data for the Miyazaki films is provided in a file named `film-data.json`. You should put this file in your `src` folder.

## Skills you're building in this project

Doing this project, you will...

- Build a component that advances through a set of data showing one item at a time, using buttons to navigate and restart
- Use state in React
- Use multiple click events in React
- Use props to pass data from a parent component to a child component

## Definition of Done

- When the page loads, the user should see the first slide.
- A user can see the next slide in the slideshow when the next button is clicked.
- A user can go back to the previous slide in the slideshow when the back button is clicked.
- A user can start over from the beginning when the Start Over button is clicked.
- A user should not be able to click on the Next button when the slide is the last one (because the button is disabled).
- A user should not be able to click on the Back button when the slide is the first one (because the button is disabled).
- A user should not be able to click on the Start Over button when the slide is the first one (because the button is disabled).
- The application should be styled, but it can be very simple. You can use a library if you want to (lightweight ones like Bulma or Materialize are good options), but your focus should be on functionality.

#### Here is an example of how a finished app should work

## How to Start

We'll use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a newer and faster alternative Create React App, to create a new React application. [What is Vite and why should you use it instead of CRA?](https://luketheweb.dev/blog/what-is-vite-and-why-should-you-use-it-instead-of-create-react-app) Glad you asked. The React documentation has [changed its recommendation to Vite instead of Create React App](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487) for creating new applications. Although you will still see applications created with Create React App out there, it's good to be familiar with other tools and approaches.

[The Vite documentation walks you through creating a React project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project). You'll run `npm create vite@latest` and follow the prompts (choose "React" as your framework; for variant, select "JavaScript"). You'll have a `src` folder like you are used to and can install dependencies with `npm` in exactly the same way. To run the server, you will need to run the command `npm run dev`. Note that `npm start` will not work by default with Vite.

‚ö†Ô∏è Pay attention to directories here. Vite will ask you for the project name. If you want it to install the files inside the directory you are currently in, you can give it `.` as the name. If you give it some other name, Vite will create a subdirectory with that name, and install the files there. Either way is fine, just be aware of what you're doing.

‚ùóIf you install the react app inside a subdirectory, note that you will need to `cd` into that subdirectory in order to run commands with npm like `npm start` or `npm install`.

Once you have scaffolded the React app, you can approach developing the slideshow app in whatever way makes the most sense to you. Here is one way you could approach it.

- Create a component called `Slideshow` in a file called `Slideshow.js`. You will need to write all the code for the slideshow in this component.
    - Optionally, you might choose to also make a Slide component, but it's not necessary to make this work.
- App.js should render the `Slideshow` component.
- Put the data file in the `src` directory and import it in the file you want to use it in.
- Pass the slide data in as a prop from App.js to the `Slideshow` component. The data can then be used in the `Slideshow` component.
- Figure out what you want the UI to look like. What HTML will the JSX need to include?
- Think about how you will make it possible to show a single film in the UI. How could this work? (hint: you'll need the `useState` hook)
- Once you have one film showing in the UI, consider how a click on the next button could tell React that the next slide should be shown. (hint: you will need an `onClick` event handler)

## üå∂Ô∏è Spicy options

- Create a sort button that allows a user to view the slides in order by release date.
- Create a Go To feature: an input field that lets a user type in the number of the slide they want to go to and the UI shows that slide immediately. Bonus: find a way to let the user go back to the slide they were on before they used Go To, even if it is not the one right before the current slide (i.e.: if a user is on slide 2, and then uses Go To to slide 7, they have an option to return to slide 2 instead of slide 6. Your UI should make this option clear to the user).
- Add [pagination](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/pagination/) [links](https://materializecss.com/pagination.html#!) to navigate through the content (those links are just some examples!).
- Instead of showing one film at a time, show a list of 10 films on each slide (or "page"). A longer data file with many more Studio Ghibli films is provided, so you can swap it in for `film-data.json`. You should provide [pagination links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Pagination) to the user.
- Imagine that this data was not being provided in a file, but was being requested from an external API. Handle a case when the data passed in as a prop contains 0 slides.
